Physics Test
============

Here's a bit of a physics playground I was working on. My main intention was
to work out how to draw wireframes and get them to behave properly in space.

Uses Ruby with Gosu and Chipmunk. Just run bundle install and then run
ruby main.rb. Arrow keys control the triangle that starts in the top left.

The most important thing I learned is that in radians, 0 points right,
but in gosu, it points up. This caused me no end of bother.
